94,Gengar,"Owing to its simplistic yet appealing design, Gengar is Ken Sugimori's favorite Pokémon as of the release of X and Y. Gengar, and its predecessors, are considered to be rivals of the Abra evolution line. During the early life of generation 1, Gastly, Haunter, and Gengar did not have the Poison type attribute, and was considered overpowered versus most Pokémon. To remedy this, the Poison part of its dual-type was added, thus making it the rival of Abra as Ghost beats Psychic and Psychic beats Poison. Gengar itself appears as a shadow with a face, legs, arms, and several spikes. Its appearance is strikingly similar to Clefable, making some fans believe that Gengars live in Clefable's shadow.[36] Others associate it with ded Clefables.[37] Fans also reacted positively when Ash Ketchum caught a Gengar in the anime.[38]Gengar has become one of the most iconic Ghost-Type Pokémon of the franchise.[39][40] Official Nintendo Magazine named Gengar one of the ten best Pokémon in the game as of 2010, stating that people ""either love Gengar or hate it.""[41] In a later reader-based poll, it placed ninth as one of the best ghost characters in a Nintendo game, which the magazine attributed to its design.[42] ONM also included it in its list of cool non-legendary Pokémon.

Former IGN editor Audrey Drake called it a ""pimp.""[46] Game Informer called it the 32nd best Pokémon.[47] Game Revolution also included it in its list of the best Pokémon at 15.[48] Patricia Hernandez criticized its Mega form, despite her admiration for Gengar. She felt that it didn't get better, just weirder. She also felt that its rarer alternate colour was worse-looking than its normal form.[49] Its Mega form was ranked third in a poll of Japanese readers by Famitsu among other Mega forms.[50] Joshua Yehi of IGN included Gengar on 10 pokemon we want in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.[51]"
95,Onix,"Though its design has been praised, critics deem Onix underpowered compared to other Rock-types of its generation. Onix is a large rock snake with a spike on its head.

98,Krabby,"As its name states, it is a crab Pokémon that is half while/tan and half orange. In the anime, it doesn't speak its name like other Pokémon. It instead makes a unique noise."
99,Kingler,"Because its pincer is so heavy, it has a hard time fighting. When it does hit, its very powerful. Only Kingler can use Krabhammer, due to its large claw. It shares a similarity to real life fiddler crabs."
100,Voltorb,"Voltorb and Electrode are some of the least popular Pokémon because of their Poké Ball-inspired designs. Even the slightest bit of electricity can make an Electrode explode. That's why it is nicknamed the ""Bomb Ball"" In the video games, Voltorb and Electrode are typically used as landmine traps by villains."
101,Electrode,

The skull is said to be its mother's. Despite this belief, no one has ever seen under its mask. There is speculation that Cubone and Marowak were once going to be part of the Kangaskhan line due to the similar appearance of the babies to Cubone."

The Fozzilized Bird and Fossilized Dino items are more common in Sword. and the Fossilized Fish and Fossilized Drake items are more common in Shield.Dracozolt was almost unbeatable in its time thanks to its powerful strong legs in its lower half of its body, while the top was entirely too small in size and while it can generate electricity in the muscles in its tail, its depletion of its plant-food resources caused its own extinction.
The shaking upper half of Arctozolts body is what generates electricity. It also could preserve food in the ice on its body to save for a later time if it was hungry. The reason why it went extinct in the first place was because it found itself too slow and it had a hard time moving around.
Dracovish's powerful jaws and legs made it the most fearless predator of its time, but its own doing made it extinct by over hunting it's underwater prey. Although it can run up to 40 mph, it can't breathe unless it's underwater. It is very popular in competitive Pokémon due to its signature move, Fishious Rend and its statistics compared to the other fossils.[24]
The skin on Arctovish's face is completely immune to attacks and while freezing its surroundings is how it hunts prey, it can have a hard time eating it due to the mouth on the top of its head. It couldn't breathe very well, leading to its extinction."
