19,Rattata,"Criticized as a ""filthy rodent"" by GamesRadar and ""rubbish"" by the Official Nintendo Magazine.[19][20] Its teeth grow very long over time, so it has to gnaw on logs, houses, telephone poles and more so it can be quite a pest at times. Rattata has an Alola Form that is an Dark/Normal Type."
20,Raticate,"Raticate is a rodent that commands the groups of Rattatas to get it food. Like Rattata, it too needs to whittle its teeth down but it does so on harder objects like steel, wood, rocks, fruit, and more. Raticate has an Alola Form that is an Dark/Normal Type."
